guide.why.title = Why This Website Exists
guide.why.text.first = When I started my journey to become a Java backend developer six months ago, I found a plenty of roadmaps for frontend such as JavaScript, but the resources for aspiring Java developers were sparse. This made the initiation process somewhat confusing and challenging for many beginners, including me.
guide.why.text.second = Even though I've been learning Java for just half a year and am still navigating my way through, I decided to create this website. It is a reflection of the roadmap I'm following in my learning process. It might not be exhaustive, but my hope is that it can be a helpful starting point for others on a similar journey.
